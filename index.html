      <h3>IT</h3>

      <h3>Logistics</h3>
      <p>I spent over four years in the freight brokerage industry, specializing in carrier sales and operations. In this role, I built and maintained relationships with carriers, negotiated rates, and ensured timely and efficient freight movement. Averaging over 250 loads and $50,000 in gross margin per month, I developed a deep understanding of logistics, supply chain dynamics, and the challenges brokers and carriers face daily. This experience has given me unique insight into optimizing workflows and improving transportation management processes.

      <h3>Software</h3>
      <p>Currently, I work in software support, assisting freight brokerages with their transportation management systems (TMS). I help users troubleshoot issues, optimize workflows, and maximize the software’s capabilities. My experience has sparked my interest in web development, leading me to learn HTML, CSS, and API integrations. I’m now exploring ways to create third-party integrations and build tools that enhance logistics software, making operations more efficient and user-friendly.
