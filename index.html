    <div class="it_experience" id="experience">
      <h3>IT</h3>
      <p>With a degree in IT and a CompTIA A+ certification, I have hands-on experience in technical support and troubleshooting. I’ve worked in IT support roles, assisting users with hardware and software issues, managing system configurations, and ensuring smooth operations across various platforms. My technical foundation has given me strong problem-solving skills and an analytical approach to diagnosing and resolving complex issues efficiently.

      <h3>Logistics</h3>
      <p>I spent over four years in the freight brokerage industry, specializing in carrier sales and operations. In this role, I built and maintained relationships with carriers, negotiated rates, and ensured timely and efficient freight movement. Averaging over 250 loads and $50,000 in gross margin per month, I developed a deep understanding of logistics, supply chain dynamics, and the challenges brokers and carriers face daily. This experience has given me unique insight into optimizing workflows and improving transportation management processes.

      <h3>Software</h3>
      <p>Currently, I work in software support, partnering with clients to troubleshoot issues, streamline workflows, and help them get the most value from their systems. Through this experience, I’ve developed a strong understanding of customer success, technical problem-solving, and effective communication across both technical and non-technical teams. I’m also expanding my technical knowledge by learning HTML, CSS, and API integrations to better understand how different systems connect and deliver value.
